What are we building:
    - An interpreter for a simple programming langauge.

What is an interpreter:
    - An interpreter is a program that takes in a source program as input and executes it.

Why:
    - Hopefully for fun is enough.
    - Build an understanding of how programming languages may be created.
    - Appreciate the hard work of langauge engineers that we take for granted whenever we write any code.

Stages:
    - Lexical analysis : breaks up input source into a sequence of tokens.
    - Syntactic analysis : figures out the different programming structures used and
                           reports errors if code doesn't conform to the grammar of the langauge. Creates an AST.
    - AST walking : traverses the AST created by the parser and exectutes each node.
